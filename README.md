**Question 1 Motivation**

Being a college town, it would be interesting to see if there are more reports and arrests for certain crimes, such as throwing loud parties, during the months in which classes are in session. Furthermore, it would be interesting to see if those numbers have changed throughout the years as a result of different populations of college students in Chapel Hill. 

**Question 2**

On certain days in a year, such as holidays and college-celebrated events, do crimes in general, or specific crimes, happen more often?

**Question 2 Motivation**

It is conceivable that there are certain days of the year during which crimes are committed more frequently, such as during celebratory occurrences like Halloween and basketball victories.

**Question 3**

Are there associations between types of crimes (e.g. violent, nonviolent, etc.) and the demographic information about the perpetrator (e.g. race, gender, etc.)?

**Question 3 Motivation**

It would be interesting to know if certain subsets of the population are more likely to commit, or at least be arrested for committing, certain crimes. We want to know if there is any statistical evidence to support common stereotypes regarding the perpetrators of crime.

**Question 4**

What are the areas in Chapel Hill that are more prone to incidents or have more arrests made? Do the incident-prone areas change over the years?

**Question 4 Motivation**

The Chapel Hill Police Department might be interested in knowing the problematic areas within Chapel Hill so that they can deploy more police officers to these areas. We are also interested in this question because, as residents of Chapel Hill, we would like to know the areas of Chapel Hill that we should avoid.

**Question 5**

How can the information gathered from all previous questions help predict next year's crimes and arrests?

**Question 5 Motivation**

The Chapel Hill Police Department may want to ensure that they have the infrastructure and employees necessary for next yearâ€™s crimes and arrests. For example, they may want to know if they need to hire more of a certain type of employee, or if they need more jail cells in the police station, based on the types of crimes they expect to see next year.
